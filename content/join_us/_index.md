Thank you for your interests in our research group. We always welcome potential new members with passion in **environmental/experimental fluid mechanics**. It is recommended that prospective students have a background in engineering (civil, mechanical, aerospace) but students from the science disciplines are also encouraged to contact me for research opportunities.

## Ph.D. students
Interested individual please email me your CV and personal statement summarizing your research experiences, preparation for graduate school, and the topic(s) you would like to work towards a PhD degree. You should articulate what aspects of your qualifications and experiences are relevant to your proposed research topics. Please also describe your career plans upon graduation. The individual
should preferably have a foundation in graduate level fluid mechanics and laboratory experiences. 

## Master students

Interested individual please email me your CV and describe any relevant experience/coursework. Preferred candidate should have good understanding of introductory fluid mechanics, linear algebra, and ordinary differential equations.

## Undergraduate students

We welcome undergraduate students seeking researach opportunity. Curiosity in fluid flows and excitement for laboratory work are all you need!
