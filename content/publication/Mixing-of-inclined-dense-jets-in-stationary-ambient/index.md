abstract: This paper reports results of a comprehensive experimental investigation of inclined round dense jets in an otherwise stagnant fluid. The tracer concentration field is measured for six jet discharge angles $\theta_{0}$ = $(15^o, 30^o, 38^o, 45^o, 52^o, \\&  60^o)$


# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We present a generalisation of the Kármán–Howarth–Monin (K–H–M) equation to include variable-density (VD) effects. The derived equation (i) reduces to the original K–H–M equation when density is a constant and (ii) leads to a VD analogue of the 4/5-law with the same value of constant (=4/5) appearing as the prefactor of the dissipation rate.
