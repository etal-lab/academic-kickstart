# Abstract.
abstract = "This paper described a method for virtual construction of turbulent jet flow field from a limited set of experimental data. The objective is for jet visualization enhancement in near-field plume models. The method is based on the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), which is an efficient tool to capture the turbulent field based on principal components. A set of experimental flow images at a number of cross-sections of a coflowing jet is obtained in the laboratory. Four hundred instantaneous flow images are taken at each jet section and are subjected to POD analysis. The first 60 principal modes are used in the reconstruction of jet turbulence via a low dimensional generation of jet images. The inclusion of additional modes is shown to produce little improvement on the visual appearance of the reconstructed jet images. Linear interpolation is attempted to generate jet images at an intermediate jet section between two experimental stations. Jet flow field on a central longitudinal section of the jet are assembled from the reconstructed flow images at all jet sections. The resulting development of concentration jet width is shown to agree well with the analytical solution."
